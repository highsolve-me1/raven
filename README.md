Raven is a simple work messaging tool that is built using [Frappe](https://frappeframework.com) and can be installed on any new or existing Frappe site (e.g. in addition to [ERPNext](https://erpnext.com/) or [FrappeHR](https://frappehr.com/)). It is designed to help teams collaborate and communicate with each other and get work done. Teams can create their own channels (publically viewable or private) and send messages, emojis, files and images.

## Motivation

Raven was born out of a need to have a simple work communication tool that could replace Slack for us at The Commit Company. Most work communication tools in the market had the following problems:

1. They include many features like video calling, audio sharing on top of work messaging which are not required for small teams. However, these features are expensive to build and run. 
2. Hence, they require payments for every user every month - regardless of how much time a user uses the tool or how many messages they send. This meant that we would have to pay for "mostly inactive" users as well.
3. We were already using [ERPNext](https://erpnext.com) hosted on [Frappe Cloud](https://frappecloud.com) for our operations. Since all our users were already on ERPNext and we were paying for the server, we thought that a simple Frappe app can solve our work communication problem - and we feel there are many other teams and organizations who would benefit in a similar way.

## Installation

Since Raven is a Frappe app, it can be installed via [frappe-bench](https://frappeframework.com/docs/v14/user/en/bench) on your local machine or on your production site.

Once you have [setup your bench](https://frappeframework.com/docs/v14/user/en/installation) and your [site](https://frappeframework.com/docs/v14/user/en/tutorial/install-and-setup-bench), you can install the app via the following commands:

```bash
bench get-app https://github.com/The-Commit-Company/Raven.git
bench --site yoursite.name install-app raven
```

Post this, you can access Raven on your Frappe site at the `/raven` endpoint (e.g. https://yoursite.com/raven). 

### Local development setup

To set up your local development environment, make sure that you have enabled [developer mode](https://frappeframework.com/how-to-enable-developer-mode-in-frappe) in your Frappe site config. 

You also need to disable CSRF (add `ignore_csrf: 1` in your `site_config.json`) since the React web server will not have any CSRF token in live reload mode. Please note that this is only for the local dev setup - not meant for Production. 

You can start the React live web server by:

```bash
cd frappe-bench/apps/raven
yarn dev
```

Your local dev server would be running at `http://localhost:8080`.
